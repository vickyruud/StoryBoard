          The Boy And The Filberts',' Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.
          The first little pig was very lazy. He did not want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.',' In Progress',' 2020-10-24', 1),('The Three Little Pigs',' A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.
          ""My boy,"" said his mother, ""be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.""
          Do not attempt too much at once.
